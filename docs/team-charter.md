### What We're Building

We're creating a blockchain system that uses **lightweight lattice-based cryptography** to protect against quantum computers without slowing everything down.

**Goal:** Prove that quantum-safe blockchain can be fast and practical.

---

### Team Rules

#### Communication

**Weekly Meetings:**
- **Tuesday** - 45-min check-in (what did you do? what's next?)
- **Sunday** - 1-hour work session (code together, help each other)

**Online Chat:**
- We use: Telegram
- Reply within 24 hours on weekdays
- If you can't make a meeting, tell the group ASAP

**GitHub:**
- Check GitHub every 2-3 days
- If someone asks you to review code, do it within 48 hours

---

#### How We Work

**Getting Work Done:**
1. We assign tasks every Tuesday
2. Everyone does their part
3. If you're stuck, ask for help in the group chat!
4. Finish your tasks before the next Tuesday

**Sharing Files:**
- All code goes on GitHub
- Meeting notes go in `docs/meeting-notes.md`
- Don't save important stuff only on your laptop!

**Supervisor Updates:**
- Email supervisor every Friday with what we did this week
- Project Manager sends the email (everyone reviews it first)

---

#### Making Decisions

- We discuss and agree together when possible
- If we can't agree, we vote
- If it's tied, the Project Manager decides (or ask supervisor)

---

#### If We Disagree

- Talk about it respectfully as a team first
- If we still can't fix it, ask the supervisor for help
- No ghosting teammates!

---

#### Expectations

✅ Show up to meetings  
✅ Do your assigned work on time  
✅ Help teammates when they're stuck  
✅ Be kind and respectful  
✅ If something comes up, communicate early  
❌ Don't wait until the last minute  
❌ Don't leave teammates hanging
